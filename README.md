# ARDE Model ‚Äì Automated Rainfall Data Evaluation Model
The ARDE Model (Automated Rainfall Data Extraction Model) is a Python-based pipeline that automates the downloading, processing, and comparison of rainfall data from multiple sources, including:

- **NWIC** (Standard Rain Gauge)

- **IMD** (Gridded Rainfall Data)

- **ERA5** (Reanalysis Data from ECMWF)

- **CHIRPS** (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation)

- **GPM IMERG** (Satellite-based Rainfall Estimates)

By integrating these datasets, ARDE allows researchers to:

- Cross-validate ground and satellite rainfall data

- Assess satellite product accuracy

- Analyze long-term rainfall trends for hydrology, disaster management, and climate studies

# üìå Getting Started
# 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ARDE-Model.git
cd ARDE-Model
```
# 2. Prerequisites
Before running the ARDE Model, ensure you have:

- **Station Data (NWIC):** Original NWIC CSV file (manual SRG)

- **CDS API Key** (for ERA5) ‚Üí Create an account at CDS and set up your .cdsapirc file

- **Google Earth Engine Account** ‚Üí Sign up here

- **GEE Project ID** (for CHIRPS extraction)

- **Earthdata Account** ‚Üí Register here for GPM IMERG downloads

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# üìÇ Data Placement
- `config.yaml` ‚Üí Place in the root folder of the repository.
This file stores station metadata, coordinates, date ranges data directories, and Authendication credentials.
- **Raw NWIC CSV** ‚Üí also place in the repo root, named e.g. `Rainfall_Murappanadu.csv`.
Example `config.yaml`:
```yaml
station_name: "Murappanadu"
lat: 8.7144
lon: 77.835
start_date: "2022-01-01"
end_date: "2024-12-31"
data_dir: ./data         # ARDE will create subfolders like ./data/NWIC
output_dir: ./results    # used by other modules
cds_url: "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api"
cds_key: "enter-the-key"
gee_project_id: "enter-your-project-ID"

```

# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run ARDE Model
- Put `config.yaml` and your raw **NWIC CSV** in the repo root.

- Open `ARDE.ipynb` (or run the provided script).

- Execute the Following Cell/Script.


# üîê Credentials (for ERA5/IMERG/CHIRPS modules)
- **ERA5 (CDS):** save your key in `~/.cdsapirc`

- **IMERG (Earthdata):** `earthaccess.login()` once per session

- **CHIRPS (GEE):** `ee.Authenticate()` and set your Project ID

# üß™ Reproducibility & Structure
- All paths are resolved relative to `config.yaml` so collaborators can run the model with their own folders by editing only that file.

- Submodules (ERA5/CHIRPS/IMERG) write into `<data_dir>/<source>/` consistently.

# ‚ùìTroubleshooting
- **File not found:** confirm config.yaml and raw NWIC CSV are in the repo root.

- **Windows paths:** avoid spaces in folder names if possible; keep them quoted in YAML.

- **Wrong station period:** check start_date/end_date in config.yaml.
