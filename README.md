# ARDE-Model
The ARDE Model streamlines downloading, processing, and comparing rainfall data from NWIC, IMD, ERA5, CHIRPS, and GPM IMERG. It unifies these datasets into one pipeline, enabling cross-validation, accuracy checks of satellite products, and analysis of long-term rainfall patterns for research and disaster management.
