ARDE Model â€“ Automated Rainfall Data Extraction Model
The ARDE Model (Automated Rainfall Data Extraction Model) is a Python-based pipeline that automates the downloading, processing, and comparison of rainfall data from multiple sources, including:

NWIC (Standard Rain Gauge)

IMD (Gridded Rainfall Data)

ERA5 (Reanalysis Data from ECMWF)

CHIRPS (Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation)

GPM IMERG (Satellite-based Rainfall Estimates)

By integrating these datasets, ARDE allows researchers to:

Cross-validate ground and satellite rainfall data

Assess satellite product accuracy

Analyze long-term rainfall trends for hydrology, disaster management, and climate studies
